# Notesappupdated
Deployed at: https://codewithshauryanoteapp.herokuapp.com/

This is My NotesApp which i created using pure javascrip and bootstrap.I used concept of localStorage and sessionStorage to store Notes in User browser.
The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser.
The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.
The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session (the data is deleted when the browser tab is closed).
